# Vue webpack template

My own vue-webpack-template

## Notes

- Add `vuex` or `vue-router` manually if you need them
- Remove `stylus` and `stylus-loader` if you don't need them, and remember to modify the `scripts/webpack/base.conf.js`. Add your own css preprocesser manually.
- Remove `@babel/preset-stage-2` if you don't need the features (mostly dynamic import) [see https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-stage-2]
